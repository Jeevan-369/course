## Assumptions about Production Deployment

### Nature of Production Deployment Target

1. **Hosting Environment:** The service assumes deployment on a standard cloud hosting platform like AWS.

2. **Containerization:** It is assumed that the production deployment supports containerization, and Docker is the chosen containerization tool.

3. **Network Configuration:** The service assumes proper network configurations, including firewall rules and domain routing.

4. **Database Compatibility:** The production environment is assumed to be compatible with the chosen database system, PostgreSQL.

5. **Scaling:** The service assumes the ability to scale horizontally to handle increased loads.

### Additional Assumptions

- The production deployment target supports Node.js runtime.
- Deployment involves using a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
